The Language Sandbox
--------------------

This is the Haskell portion of Droogans' Language Sandbox. Consider this repo an
excuse to get hands-on experience with Haskell before I do something significant
with it.

### Rosalind ###
A collection of problems from http://rosalind.info/ . Most involve string
processing in some way, but many also involve other mathematical concepts
(such as graphs).

Conventions
----------

1. Trivial cases may not be runnable as a program. There will be a clearly-named
function to run instead.

3. If a module ends in "lib", it is intended as a library.

4. The programs herein will not be
written for speed. They will either be written for comprehendability,
convenience, or to demonstrate a particular language feature.

6. If unit testing is included, it will be a "test" function containing a 
series of pattern-matching equalities, ie expectedRV = function(arg1, ...)
